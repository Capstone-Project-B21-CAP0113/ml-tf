# ml-tf
A repo for machine learning path.

This repo contains 2 different folders.
- Backend Folder contains a simple backend to serve the prediction as REST API, and a simple graphical interface to interact with the API
- Laporan Folder contains machine learning related files, saved model, notebook, and datasets.

Details of these folders can be seen in the README.md of each folder.

# KoPi

A solution for your city communications!

# Goal

We want the government and the community to have an easier communication tools for their city growth.

## Benefit

The community can share their troubles and thoughts with report and aspiration and with that the government can have the information on problems what they need to solve in their city. The government can also share their city event and another information related so the community won't feel left out on something.

## Proposed Features

1. The community can share their thoughts if they're not satisfied with their city condition through the "aspiration" choice.
2. The community can report what's wrong in their city so the government can take an immediate action through the "report" choice.
3. The government can share information in their city through the "event" choice.
4. The government can share what's happen on their city through the "news" choice.
5. If the community already submit their report and aspiration, they can see the government action in their profile related to the problem.
6. If the community confused what should their choose for their problem, there's a list for a government or BUMN in their city related to the aspiration or the report.
